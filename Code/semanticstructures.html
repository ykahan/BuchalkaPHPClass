  <h1>Semantic Structuring</h1>
  <p>Here's a list of various semantic tags:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <header>This is the header.  It can be used for navigational aids or introductory
        information. It might also contain a logo, a search box, and so forth.</header>
      </li>
      <li>
        <nav>This is a nav tag.  It is used for navigation links, such as a menu or table of
          contents.</nav>
        </li>
        <li><main>Here's a main tag.  It's used for the primary content of a page.</main></li>
        <li>
          <span>The span tag allows you to mark particular content for styling purposes.
            A span tag is shown in the same line with the surrounding content.</span>
          </li>
          <li><div>So does the div tag.  A div element gets a new line in the browser..</div></li>
          <li>
            <article>An article tag, like this one, is used for a piece of content which would make
              sense even extracted from the web page.  Like, you know, an <em>article</em>.
            </article>
          </li>
          <li>
            <section>A section tag is used for standalone functionality which lacks a more specific
              element to represent it.  A nav bar would not go here, but a list of search results would.
            </section>
          </li>
          <li><aside>An aside tag is used to contain tangentially related content.</aside></li>
          <li>
            <footer>A footer tag would contain information about the author, copyright information,
              or perhaps a series of links replicating nav bar functionality.</footer>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hey, just for fun, here's a link to
            <a href="http://www.torahanytime.com">Torah Anytime</a>!  And <a href="page2.html">
              here</a>'s a link that
              doesn't go anywhere.</p>
              <img src="example.png" alt="picture of nothing">
              <div id="root"></div>
              <script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            </body>
            </html>
