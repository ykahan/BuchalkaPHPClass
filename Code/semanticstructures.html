<body>
  <header>This is the header.  It can be used for navigational aids or introductory
    information. It might also contain a logo, a search box, and so forth.</header>
  <nav>This is a nav tag.  It is used for navigation links, such as a menu or table of
    contents.</nav>
  <main>Here's a main tag.  It's used for the primary content of a page.</main>
  <span>The span tag allows you to mark particular content for styling purposes.</span>
  <div>So does the div tag.  We'll discuss later how div is different from span.</div>
  <article>An article tag, like this one, is used for a piece of content which would make
    sense even extracted from the web page.  Like, you know, an <em>article</em>.
  </article>
    <section>A section tag is used for standalone functionality which lacks a more specific
      element to represent it.  A nav bar would not go here, but a list of search results would.
    </section>
    <aside>An aside tag is used to contain tangentially related content.</aside>
    <footer>A footer tag would contain information about the author, copyright information,
      or perhaps a series of links replicating nav bar functionality.</footer>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
