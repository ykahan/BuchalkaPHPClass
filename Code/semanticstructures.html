  <nav>This is a nav tag.  It is used for navigation links, such as a menu or table of
    contents.</nav>
  <main>Here's a main tag.  It's used for the primary content of a page.</main>
  <article>An article tag, like this one, is used for a piece of content which would make
    sense even extracted from the web page.  Like, you know, an <em>article</em>.
  </article>
    <section>A section tag is used for standalone functionality which lacks a more specific
      element to represent it.  A nav bar would not go here, but a list of search results would.
